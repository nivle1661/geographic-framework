Contained in out/artifacts/hw5c_jar

## New Plugins

###### Data plugins
**Recorder** : Records audio from the microphone for a specificed amount of time in seconds (whole numbers only). For some reason, the .wav file isn't added to library but upon closing and rerunning it will be added to the library.

###### Visual plugins
**Spectrum Visualizer** : Takes in the frequency array and creates a circular bar graph with each bar corresponding to a certain bucket of frequency. Similar to the Radar Visualizer but done with a bar graph and handled with an API towards static graphs, not visualizations.
